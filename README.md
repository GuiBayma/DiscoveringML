# DiscoveringML

## WWDC 2019 Scholarsip submission

Discovering ML is a `playgroundbook` that tells a little bit about *Machine Learning* in a fun way.

In the book the user interacts with a robot named Smarty

At first Smarty can't do much

But as the book goes on Smarty is able to analyze sentences and discern if it is a good, bad or neutral sentence

Depending on the sentence Smarty will react accordingly
